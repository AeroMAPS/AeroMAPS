# AeroMAPS Models

This section describes the disciplinary models implemented in AeroMAPS.

The navigation in this documùentation is organized by package:

- **Base, constants, parameters**: common building blocks shared across models.
- **Air transport**: traffic, aircraft fleet and operations, and related submodels.
- **Impacts**: emissions, climate impacts, costs, life cycle assessment, and
  other impact models.
- **Sustainability assessment**: climate and equivalent carbon budgets.
- **Optimisation**: elementary models to define constraints used in optimisation problems.

Each subpage is auto-generated from the Python docstrings using mkdocstrings.

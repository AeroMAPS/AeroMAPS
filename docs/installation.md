# Installation

## Quick start

For a quick start in order to discover the different features of AeroMAPS,
a graphical user interface has been developed for facilitating the first uses.
It is available at the following address: https://cast.isae-supaero.fr


## Installation from the Python Package Index (PyPI)

The Python Package Index can be used for installing AeroMAPS.

**Prerequisite**: AeroMAPS needs at least **Python 3.7.0**.

It is recommended (but not required) to install AeroMAPS in a virtual
environment ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/),
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html), ...)

Once Python is installed, AeroMAPS can be installed using pip.

> **Note**: If your network uses a proxy, you may have to do [some
> settings](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server)
> for pip to work correctly

You can install the latest version with this command:

``` {.bash}
$ pip install --upgrade aeromaps
```

# Welcome to AeroMAPS Documentation !

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport. For 
instance, it allows simulating and analyzing scenarios for reducing aviation climate impacts through various levers of 
action. It is intended to become a sectoral Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) taking into account technological, 
environmental, sociological, economic and other considerations. It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated air 
transport transition scenarios on multiple criteria.

The objective of this documentation is to provide the main elements concerning AeroMAPS.

In particular, see:  
- [API Reference](api/index.md) — understanding the intended use of user-facing functions and classes.  
- [AeroMAPS Models](models/index.md) — details on each model used by the framework.  
- [User documentation](documentation/index.md) — general principles of AeroMAPS, including example applications.  


## About AeroMAPS

AeroMAPS, formerly CAST published in 2021, is an open-source framework developed in Python by ISAE-SUPAERO (Toulouse, 
France). It is also fed by multiple multidisciplinary works from the Institute for Sustainable Aviation (ISA).
Providing a free framework that researchers, organizations, authorities and companies can interact with for
defining sustainable aviation prospective scenarios was the initial main motivation.

# Software developments

Regarding the software developments of the framework, AeroMAPS is developed using the Python programming language. 
The data and models are mainly manipulated and implemented using the Pandas package but also use other scientific 
computing package like GEMSEO and SciPy for solving implicit models for instance. The user interface uses ipywidgets 
for the widgets and ipympl for the graphs. The AeroMAPS software is deployed as a web application thanks to Voil√†.

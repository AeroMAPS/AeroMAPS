# Other examples

This page references links to other AeroMAPS example notebooks, either in the form of tutorials, or in the form of more 
advanced applications in the context of research publications. 

For maintenance simplicity, the notebooks are simply hosted in our GitHub repository instead of being duplicated in 
the documentation.

In order to run these notebooks, the simplest method is to use the following command line, creating a folder with all 
the tutorial notebooks.

```
aeromaps notebooks
```

You can also directly download them and run them locally in a Jupyter environment, alternatively using our [Binder](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/AeroMAPS/AeroMAPS/HEAD),
including the advanced notebooks.

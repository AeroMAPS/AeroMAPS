# Installation

## Quick start

For a quick start in order to discover the simplest features of AeroMAPS,
a graphical user interface has been developed for facilitating the first uses.
It is available at the following address: [https://aeromaps.eu/](https://aeromaps.eu/)


## Quick installation

The use of the Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/)) is the simplest method for installing AeroCM.

**Prerequisite**: AeroMAPS needs at least **Python 3.10.0**.

You can install the latest version with this command:

```
pip install --upgrade aeromaps
```

If you also want to use the custom life cycle assessment model (which requires a valid ecoinvent license), use the following command:

```
pip install --upgrade aeromaps[lca]
```

All user-facing execution is performed through an AeroMAPSProcess object. 
Some configuration files operations can also be executed through utility functions, also described by this API.

    A full description of the whole AeroMAPS package, including disciplinary models implemented in AeroMAPS can be found in the [AeroMAPS Models](../full_doc/index.md) section of the documentation.

    "# Advanced example for running an LCA in AeroMAPS \n",
    "\n",
    "> *This notebook requires a valid ecoinvent license. You also need to install the corresponding LCA packages with `pip install --upgrade aeromaps[lca]`*\n",
    "\n",
    "For advanced users willing to customize the LCA model, this notebook shows how to set up and run an AeroMAPS simulation with a custom LCA model defined in a configuration YAML file. \n",
    "\n",
    "The custom LCA model used in this example is defined in the file `data/lca_data/custom_model/custom_lca_model.yaml`. It includes:\n",
    "- The name of the LCA project (this will install or reuse the corresponding [Brightway](https://docs.brightway.dev/en/latest/) project).\n",
    "- The LCA database to use (ecoinvent 3.10 cutoff in this example).\n",
    "- The SSP-RCPs scenario to use for projecting the ecoinvent background data with [premise](https://premise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) (SSP2 with no climate policy in this example - you may change depending on the latest developments of premise).\n",
    "- The LCA model definition (also referred to as a parametric inventory), which defines the various datasets to be imported from ecoinvent and how they are connected to the AeroMAPS processes/parameters. You may also tag the datasets with a \"phase\" attribute to split the LCA results by life cycle phase (as done in this example).\n",
    "- The impact assessment methods to use (either from LCIA methods defined in Brightway/ecoinvent or custom methods with characterization factors provided in CSV files).\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information on how to define a custom LCA model through a configuration file, please refer to the [LCA-Modeller](https://github.com/AeroMAPS/lca-modeller) library, a side project of AeroMAPS dedicated to the definition of parametric LCA models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> ***Note**: The first time you run this notebook, it may take a dozen minutes depending on the complexity of the LCA model, as it will install the ecoinvent and premise databases (unless previously installed) and parametrize the LCA model declared in the configuration file (each time the kernel is restarted). Subsequent runs will be much faster.*\n",

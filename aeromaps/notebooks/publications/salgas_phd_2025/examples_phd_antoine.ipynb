For  information, the capital part represent around 16% of the total DOC-NE and other costs 84%. A composite evolution can therefore be computed. The capital part is obtained (outside of AeroMAPS) by computing an equivalent annual cost (**EAC**), using an annuity factor of 0.07 (computed for 25 years, under a 5% Interest rate). It can be modified to represent a increase in aircraft cost or lifespan. ($\\text{EAC} = \\frac{CAP_{t0} \\times i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}} $).

    "    - *Grid*: Grid electricity input is assumed to cost 70€ per MWh in 2019, as a coarse mean between [europe](https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/databrowser/view/nrg_pc_205/default/table?lang=en) and [usa](https://www.statista.com/statistics/190680/us-industrial-consumer-price-estimates-for-retail-electricity-since-1970/). If considering grid electricity alows for high load factors, it requires the full consideration of backups and tranportation systems (infrastructure), meaning that considering per technology LCOE can be a major shortcomming. Grid electricity prices in 2050 are not widely available, but a value of 100€/Mwh seems to be adequate with respect to total system costs estimated by French network administrator [RTE](https://assets.rte-france.com/prod/2022-06/Futurs%20%C3%A9nerg%C3%A9tiques%202050%20_%20rapport%20complet.zip). Baseline emission factor for the grid is [450 g$CO_2$/KWh](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-intensity-electricity?time=2019) and are arbitrarily set at 20 g$CO_2$/KWh in 2050, in line with total low-carbon system emissions of [RTE](https://assets.rte-france.com/prod/2022-06/).

Similarily, a global budget can be defined in terms of equivalen carbon budgets (accounting for non-CO2 effects), of biomass available for bioenergy, and Electricity (altough the notion of ressource is less direct in this case).  \n",
    "Then the budgets are scaled down at the sectoral level using allocation rules. In this case, $CO_2$ budget is allocated using a grandfathering approach, giving to aviation a similar share to its annual contribution to annual emissions (2.6%). A similar approach is used for total warming budget. Biomass and electricity budgets are arbitraily set at 5%.  \n",
    "The secenario respects the energy budgets, but slightly exceeds $CO_2$ budget  vs (3.4 vs 2.6%) and largely exceeds total warming budget. Non-CO2 mitigation measures are not activated neither investigated in this work as it is not the main topic. They are however crucial to mitigate aviation related warming. Some CO2 mitigation measures have also an impact on non-CO2 (positive or negative).\n",
    "\n",
    "The budget in itself is not a definitive metric: aviation could be allocated a larger budget than its historic contribution, but it means other sectors should decarbonize faster to respect a gloabl temperature target. "

    "This first MACC curve can be seen a different points in time using the interactive widget (slider).  \n",
    "The selection widget can be used to select the three different carbon abatement cost metrics defined in the paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "<u>Preliminary remark</u>:  \n",
    "Two zones can be identified:\n",
    "- *positive abatements* (blue background). These measures actually reduce air transport $CO_2$ emission compared to the reference considered. Negative abatements costs are linked to cost savings (on the perimeter considered), and positive abatement costs to extra costs. \n",
    "- *negative abatements* (red background) are extra emissions compared to the reference considered. For instance, for aircraft efficiency levers, the reference is the average energy intensity of 2019. Therefore, aircraft that uses more energy than the average (old reference aircraft) are in the red zone. as carbon abatement costs are defined considereing emission reduction as positive and cost reduction as negative, Therefore, this red zone is counter intuitive: negative abatement cost are options that are both more expensive to operate and more emissive than the reference. Besides, GSCAC and SCAC are computed through the whole life of the plant, meaning they could have overall negative emissions, while it is not yet the case in the scenario; then , they are in the red zone, whith positive abatement cost, and should be treated equally as other blue zone options. Overall, comparing options in this zone is not recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-c.1/ Instantaneous carbon abatement cost (*ICAC*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the article for the in depth definition of the instantaneous carbon abatement cost.  \n",
    "To summarize, it is an easy to compute carbon abatement cost to compare, at a given point in time, the relative efficiency of different abatement options. However, it should not be used to decide when a project should be launched based on the comparison to a reference carbon value or to chose a project over another (or at least this value must be constant to do so).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few comments on several points in time: \n",
    "- 2020 is heavyliy impacted by covid, which degrades both load factor and aircraft efficiency (empty flights?). This particular case is not what the curves are meant for. \n",
    "- In 2025 most of the abatement comes from efficiency abatement options, which, in this case are also less expensive. Although energy options are much more expensive, they are marginally utilized at this point in the blending mandate that was defined above.\n",
    "- For 2030; comments are similar, exception being e-fuel, whith a massive negative CAC/neative abatement. As seens in part 3-a) of the notebook, this is linked to the evolution of the electricity emission factor, which results in electrofuel evolving progressively from a worse to a better fuel than kerosene. Since emissio factors are at the denominator of the carbon abatement cost, it creates a vertical asymptote when emission factors are equal. The effect can be seen in the following years, with electrofuel switching to the blue zone, and with a rapidly decreasing CAC, despite a moderately decreasing MFSP. The metric is thus not particularly relevant to compare options whith very similar emissions factors. \n",
    "- 2035 is characterized by the EIS of the first hydrogen aircraft in the scenario. The effect of the aircraft itself can be seen in the blue zone: with the parameters set, the aicrfat uses less energy than the 2019 average. However, the extra non-fuel doc specified (+10%) results in a positive CAC. The hydrogen is considered to be produced as sepecified in the settings: unabated fossil-based hydrogen is in the red zone. Their carbon-capture counterparts are relatively cost efficient when compared to biofuels, and to electrolysis hydrogen.\n",
    "- No other major changes occur until teh end of the scenario; however, e-fuel and electrolysis-hydrogen become more cost competitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-c.2/ Specific carbon abatement cost (*SCAC*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments drawn before are still valid. However, the specific abatement cost is much more relevant to evaluate projects, by evalauting their economic relevance at their launch date. Refer to the article for a discussion on this specific point. Since the costs of the projects are discounted throughout their lifespan, and that the evalution takes into account the future evolution of prices and emissions, the SCAC is lower than the ICAC at the same date.  \n",
    "They can be compared to a carbon value that grows with the discout rate (see next section).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-c.3/ Generic - Specific carbon abatement cost (*G-SCAC*)\n",

    "- for the specific carbon abatement cost, however, it is possible to visualize on a single graph, which measures are economically interesting considering a hotelling carbon value, and when they become attractive, making their usage desirable. Another widget alows, in this case, to chose a starting value for the carbon price. The dotted zone represents measures whose specific abatement cost is higher than the reference value at this point in time. As a reminer, the interest in this case is that the abatement cost is independant from the carbon price trajectory.\n",
    "\n",
    "- the generic abatement cost allows for a reference carbon price that is not growing with the discount rate.

Besides, it reveals one very important aspect of this curve: between 2035 and 2050, hydrogen aircraft are considered interesting, because they provide energy savings. However, none of hydrogen production pathways are interesting before 2048 (Gas CCS). In this case, computing a composite carbon abatement cost of those two options, to determine when the aircraft system should start being used, seems a relevant recommandation. \n",

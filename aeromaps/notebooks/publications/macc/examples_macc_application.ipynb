For  information, the capital part represent around 16% of the total DOC-NE and other costs 84%. A composite evolution can therefore be computed. The capital part is obtained (outside of AeroMAPS) by computing an equivalent annual cost (**EAC**), using an annuity factor of 0.07 (computed for 25 years, under a 5% Interest rate). It can be modified to represent a increase in aircraft cost or lifespan. ($\\text{EAC} = \\frac{CAP_{t0} \\times i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-n}} $).

Prices swicth from pessimistic to median to optimistic values in 2020-2035-2050, as well as efficiencies, which are defined by the ratio of the hydrogen energy with this value plus the energy necessary to liquefy the hydrogen.

If considering grid electricity alows for high load factors, it requires the full consideration of backups and tranportation systems (infrastructure), meaning that considering per technology LCOE can be a major shortcomming. Grid electricity prices in 2050 are not widely available, but a value of 100€/Mwh seems to be adequate with respect to total system costs estimated by French network administrator [RTE](https://assets.rte-france.com/prod/2022-06/Futurs%20%C3%A9nerg%C3%A9tiques%202050%20_%20rapport%20complet.zip). Baseline emission factor for the grid is [450 g$CO_2$/KWh](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/carbon-intensity-electricity?time=2019) and are arbitrarily set at 20 g$CO_2$/KWh in 2050, in line with total low-carbon system emissions of [RTE](https://assets.rte-france.com/prod/2022-06/).

    "\n",
    "<u>Preliminary remark</u>:  \n",
    "Two zones can be identified:\n",
    "- *positive abatements* (blue background). These measures actually reduce air transport $CO_2$ emission compared to the reference considered. Negative abatements costs are linked to cost savings (on the perimeter considered), and positive abatement costs to extra costs. \n",
    "- *negative abatements* (red background) are extra emissions compared to the reference considered. For instance, for aircraft efficiency levers, the reference is the average energy intensity of 2019. Therefore, aircraft that uses more energy than the average (old reference aircraft) are in the red zone. as carbon abatement costs are defined considereing emission reduction as positive and cost reduction as negative, Therefore, this red zone is counter intuitive: negative abatement cost are options that are both more expensive to operate and more emissive than the reference. Besides, GSCAC and SCAC are computed through the whole life of the plant, meaning they could have overall negative emissions, while it is not yet the case in the scenario; then , they are in the red zone, whith positive abatement cost, and should be treated equally as other blue zone options. Overall, comparing options in this zone is not recommended. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-c.1/ Instantaneous carbon abatement cost (*ICAC*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the Supplementary Material - Part I for the in depth definition of the instantaneous carbon abatement cost.  \n",
    "To summarize, it is an easy to compute carbon abatement cost to compare, at a given point in time, the relative efficiency of different abatement options. However, it should not be used to decide when a project should be launched based on the comparison to a reference carbon value or to chose a project over another (or at least this value must be constant to do so).\n",
    "\n",
    "A few comments on several points in time: \n",
    "- 2020 is heavyliy impacted by covid, which degrades both load factor and aircraft efficiency (empty flights?). This particular case is not what the curves are meant for. \n",
    "- In 2025 most of the abatement comes from efficiency abatement options, which, in this case are also less expensive. Although energy options are much more expensive, they are marginally utilized at this point in the blending mandate that was defined above.\n",
    "- For 2030; comments are similar, exception being e-fuel, whith a massive negative CAC/neative abatement. As seens in part 3-a) of the notebook, this is linked to the evolution of the electricity emission factor, which results in electrofuel evolving progressively from a worse to a better fuel than kerosene. Since emissio factors are at the denominator of the carbon abatement cost, it creates a vertical asymptote when emission factors are equal. The effect can be seen in the following years, with electrofuel switching to the blue zone, and with a rapidly decreasing CAC, despite a moderately decreasing MFSP. The metric is thus not particularly relevant to compare options whith very similar emissions factors. \n",
    "- 2035 is characterized by the EIS of the first hydrogen aircraft in the scenario. The effect of the aircraft itself can be seen in the blue zone: with the parameters set, the aicrfat uses less energy than the 2019 average. However, the extra non-fuel doc specified (+10%) results in a positive CAC. The hydrogen is considered to be produced as sepecified in the settings: unabated fossil-based hydrogen is in the red zone. Their carbon-capture counterparts are relatively cost efficient when compared to biofuels, and to electrolysis hydrogen.\n",
    "- No other major changes occur until teh end of the scenario; however, e-fuel and electrolysis-hydrogen become more cost competitive. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3-c.2/ Specific carbon abatement cost (*SCAC*)\n",
    "\n",
    "The comments drawn before are still valid. However, the specific abatement cost is much more relevant to evaluate projects, by evalauting their economic relevance at their launch date. Refer to the article for a discussion on this specific point. Since the costs of the projects are discounted throughout their lifespan, and that the evalution takes into account the future evolution of prices and emissions, the SCAC is lower than the ICAC at the same date.  \n",
    "They can be compared to a carbon value that grows with the discout rate (see next section).\n",

Another widget alows, in this case, to chose a starting value for the carbon price. The dotted zone represents measures whose specific abatement cost is higher than the reference value at this point in time. As a reminer, the interest in this case is that the abatement cost is independant from the carbon price trajectory.\n",

    "## 4-c) Dedicated renewables and discount rate: sensitivity analysis \n",
    "\n",
    "Carbon abatement costs combine uncertainties of various nature on costs (technological, financial...) but also on emission factors. Abatement potentials also introduce uncertainties on each option's availability. MACC are therefore prone to uncertainty propagation. Links between those uncertainties are also potentially meaningful. This is not in the scope of this paper, but this section paves the way in that direction by performing a sensitivity analysis on the abatement costs of electrofuels. The observations and remarks are, however, applicable to all other abatement costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "As can illsutrated on the detailled MFSP figure above in this scenario, a very large proportion of the MFSP for electrofuel and hydrogen produced by electrolysis is associated with electricity. Therefore, it seems appropriate to carry out a sensitivity analysis on this parameter, given that the assumptions considered here are conservative, assuming a slight increase in grid electricity prices. Indeed, sources using dedicated renewable electricity, such as [Ueckerdt et al.](10.1038/s41558-021-01032-7), report significantly lower production costs. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the use of dedicated renewables is subject to an additionality requirement in Europe ([European Commission Directive](http://data.europa.eu/eli/reg_del/2023/1184/oj/eng)). Indeed, renewables are needed to decarbonise most electricity grids, but also to increase their capacity for direct electrification and hydrogen production. As long as grids are not decarbonised, using the electricity to produce hydrogen or electrofuels could be worse than using it elsewhere, depending on the characteristics of each use case. For instance, a given amount of electricity used in electric cars replaces more final energy than if used to produce electrofuels due to the higher overall efficiency ([Ueckerdt et al.](10.1038/s41558-021-01032-7)). These issues are not considered in this paper. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To test the effect of dedicated renewables on e-fuel prices, a sensitivity analysis is conducted below, considering different financial conditions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Three scenarios are defined, a reference, identical to the illustrative scenario of the artcile is defined, as well as one considering only solar and one only wind power. \n",

    "## Detailled comment - sensitivity to prices and discounting.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Plain lines in the figure above illustrate the effect of considering dedicated renewable instead of grid electricity for electrofuel production. Assumptions taken for costs range from 61 €/MWh in 2020 to 46 €/MWh in 2050 for wind (58 to 26 for solar). The emission factor evolves from 15 to 11.5 gCO\\textsubscript{2}/kWh for wind (43 to 21 for solar). Finally, the average load factor evolves from 40% to 45% for wind (13% to 14% for solar). These numbers are based on [RTE French Grid scenarios](https://assets.rte-france.com/prod/public/2022-01/Energy%20pathways%202050_Key%20results.pdf) and [IAE Net Zero](https://www.iea.org/reports/net-zero-roadmap-a-global-pathway-to-keep-the-15-0c-goal-in-reach). \n",
    "\n",
    "Using wind power drastically lowers the SCAC of electrofuels at any point in time. However, using photovoltaic power increases the abatement costs. Indeed, the savings from a lower emission factor and lower costs are outweighed by the very low load factor: to ensure the same output, one would need seven times more electrofuel production capacity compared to using grid electricity. Note that the potential hydrogen storage between the electrolysis and the hydrocarbon synthesis is not modelled for e-fuels; this could reduce this effect. With solar power, the mean MFSP in 2035 would be 4.8 €/L compared to 3.0 €/L in the reference case and 2.9 €/L with dedicated wind power. However, capital counts for 68.5% of the MFSP in the solar case, while electricity expenses represent 12%. This proportion is reversed to 16% and 56% respectively for the grid case. \n",
    "\n",
    "The cost of the capital considered seems to be a crucial parameter in the evaluation of the MFSP for e-fuels. By default, it is set arbitrarily at 10%. By reducing it to a value close to a social discount rate (4.5%), using dedicated solar electricity becomes more interesting than grid electricity, as illustrated in the figure above. However, wind power, which is intermediate in terms of price and load factor, remains below this value under both hypotheses. \n",
    "\n",
    "The sensitivity of the SCAC to the socio-economic discount rate (with a default 10% private interest rate) is also studied in the figure above. Considering a zero socio-economic discount rate increases the SCAC of electrofuel via dedicated solar power by 60% in 2040, all other things being equal. Considering it at 10% reduces this SCAC by 35%. However, the carbon price trajectories with which to compare these values would be very different than those considered in this paper (in which discount rates are around 4%). Indeed, a null discount rate gives much more importance to future monetary flows. There is therefore no reason to wait for the most expensive options: all those needed to achieve a given objective must be carried out immediately, giving a much higher initial value to the CP. Conversely, a very high discount rate postpones efforts until as late as possible, resulting in a very low initial value. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is also interesting to examine how the electricity source influences the cost-effective introduction date. Under the high carbon price trajectory used in this paper (with default interest and social discount rates), electrofuels are cost-effective to introduce in 2041/2042 for the grid case, in 2044 for the photovoltaic case, and in 2037 for the wind power case. This difference is limited given the range of cost and emission factors involved in these different source scenarios.\n"

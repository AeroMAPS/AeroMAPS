AeroMAPS: Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport
====

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport.
It is intended to become a sectoral Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) taking into account technological, environmental,
sociological, economic and other considerations.
It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated air transport transition scenarios on multiple criteria.

More details can be found in the `documentation <https://aeromaps.github.io/AeroMAPS/>`_.

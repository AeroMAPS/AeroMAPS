AeroMAPS: Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport
====

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport.
It is intended to become a sectoral Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) taking into account technological, environmental,
sociological, economic and other considerations.
It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated air transport transition scenarios on multiple criteria.

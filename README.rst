AeroMAPS: Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport
====

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport.
It is intended to become a sectoral Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) taking into account technological, sociological, economical and other considerations.
It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated air transport transition scenarios on multiple criteria.

More details can be found in the `official documentation <https://test-cast-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.


Quick start
--------

For a quick start in order to discover the different features of AeroMAPS,
a graphical user interface has been developed for facilitating the first uses.
It is available at the following address: https://cast.isae-supaero.fr


Quick installation
--------

**Prerequisite**: AeroMAPS needs at least **Python 3.7.0**.

It is recommended (but not required) to install AeroMAPS in a virtual
environment ([conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/),
[venv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/venv.html), ...)

Once Python is installed, AeroMAPS can be installed using pip.

> **Note**: If your network uses a proxy, you may have to do [some
> settings](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#using-a-proxy-server)
> for pip to work correctly

You can install the latest version with this command:

``` {.bash}
$ pip install --upgrade aeromaps
```

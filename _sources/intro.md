# Welcome to the AeroMAPS documentation

AeroMAPS is a framework for performing Multidisciplinary Assessment of Prospective Scenarios for air transport. For 
instance, it allows simulating and analyzing scenarios for reducing aviation climate impacts through various levers of 
action. It is intended to become a sectoral Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) taking into account technological, 
environmental, sociological, economic and other considerations. It aims to assess the sustainability of simulated air 
transport transition scenarios on multiple criteria.

The objective of this documentation is to provide the main elements concerning AeroMAPS.
In particular, check out the installation section for understanding how to use AeroMAPS, 
the documentation section for understanding the general principles of AeroMAPS, 
and the examples section for discovering some applications.

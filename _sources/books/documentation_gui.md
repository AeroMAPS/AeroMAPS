Finally, as mentioned previously, the global Covid-19 outbreak has significantly disrupted global air traffic in 2020. 
The consequences of the latter are likely to disrupt global traffic for several years. To take account of this 
epidemic, this option incorporates a 66% decline in traffic in 2020 compared with 2019 and a return to the 2019 level 
by 2024 according to 
<a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/6dfc19c3fdce4c9c8d5f1565c472b53f/2020-09-29-02-fr.pdf" target="_blank">IATA</a>. 
This option also takes into account the one-off change in the aircraft load factor in 2020, which has dropped to 
58.5% according to 
<a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/6dfc19c3fdce4c9c8d5f1565c472b53f/2020-09-29-02-fr.pdf" target="_blank">IATA</a>, 
against 82.4% in 2019. Thus, due to this deterioration in the aircraft load factor, a paradoxical situation is present 
on the tool. Indeed, the deterioration in the aircraft load factor, considered as a potential improvement in 
efficiency, leads here to an increase in emissions compared to those expected without modification of the 
efficiency levers of action. + E/ASK

Societal aspects on the distribution of flights. The results of this part are based on the work of S. GÃ¶ssling and 
A. Humpe in 2020 in 
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020307779" target="_blank">*The global scale, distribution and growth of aviation: Implications for climate change*</a>. 
The authors show that only 11% of the world's population flies, and only between 2 and 4% go abroad. Moreover, 
'frequent flyers', about 1% of the world's population who fly an average of 56,000 km per year (about 3 
long-range trips), are responsible for about 50% of aviation $CO_2$ emissions, taking into account their number of 
flights but also the more frequent use of upper classes. Therefore, if on average these 'frequent flyers' flew half 
as often, aviation emissions would be reduced by 25%.

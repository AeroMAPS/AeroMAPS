# Use of the graphical user interface

This page guides the user through the handling of the AeroMAPS Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is recommended to use 
it on a computer. In a first step, a tutorial is provided for understanding the use of the GUI. In a second step, the 
default settings used on the GUI are provided. For details concerning the models, refer to the dedicated sections of 
this documentation.


## Tutorial

The AeroMAPS GUI is composed of 3 tabs: 
- **Simulator** which is the integrated simulator to directly simulate prospective scenarios for air transport ;
- **Data** which allows to visualize data and retrieve them in CSV format in order to post-process them ;
- **About AeroMAPS** which provides brief information, explanations and documentation about the framework.

Moving on the tool and on the explanatory tabs is quite intuitive by clicking on the corresponding tabs. To adjust 
the size of the tool to the size of his screen, the user can use the zoom (out) functionalities on his browser. 
The display language can be chosen : English or French (coming soon).

To use the AeroMAPS simulator, the user must select the **Simulator** tab. Two distinct blocks then appear on the 
user's screen (see the following figure). 

![](/figs/tutorial_page.png)

On the one hand, three different graphs are available in the upper part of the screen, with the possibility of 
selecting specific figures using drop-down menus. A first graph allows plotting 
CO<sub>2</sub> emissions or effective radiative forcing from aviation. A second one provide figures concerning the 
assessment of the sustainability of a scenario, for instance in terms of climate. A last graph represents a set of 
figures for analyzing scenarios more deeply.

On the other hand, a set of sliders is available in the lower part of the screen for performing scenario simulation.
For facilitating the handling of the tool according to the user, the user can use three distinct modes of varying 
complexity. In the *Discovery mode*, the user uses directly sliders: this mode provides a good understanding of the 
sensitivities of the main levers of action. In the *Scenarios mode*, the user displays scenarios that have already been 
defined and parameterized: this is the easiest mode to use which only allows analyzing scenarios. Finally, the 
*Advanced mode*, not directly available on the GUI, links to the AeroMAPS GitHub to be able to manipulate in detail the 
AeroMAPS framework using Jupyter Notebooks.

> **_NOTE:_**  Additional information on the different levers of action on the *Discovery mode* is provided by hovering 
> the mouse over them (tooltip).

To illustrate the handling of AeroMAPS, an animation is given below. In this animation, the user tries out different 
AeroMAPS functionalities: moving on the tabs, using different simulator modes, displaying different figures, setting 
scenario parameters.

## Reference settings

The different default settings for using the interface are detailed in the following, both for the *Discovery mode* and
the *Scenarios mode*. For accessing to the detailed data, the advanced user can directly check the values into the code
in the GUI section.


### *Discovery mode*

In this mode, the user can play with different sliders corresponding roughly to the AeroMAPS architecture. On the 
one hand, aviation settings are provided for modeling the air transport evolution through air traffic, aircraft 
fleet and operations, and aircraft energy. On the other hand, environmental settings are given via climate and energy 
assumptions and allocations choices.

#### Air traffic

The user can first make assumptions on the evolution of air traffic.

Overall, the user can directly define mean air traffic growth rates on the 
period 2020--2050 for the four considered markets in the model: passenger short-range, passenger medium-range, 
passenger long-range and freight. By default, these values are fixed to 3% per year, i.e. values close to aviation
industry's projections {cite}`atagwaypoint`.

Moreover, by default, a modeling of Covid-19 epidemic is included. It significantly disrupted global air traffic
in 2020 and its consequences are likely to disrupt global traffic for several years. To take account of this 
epidemic, this option incorporates a 66% decline in traffic in 2020 compared with 2019 and a return to the 2019 level 
by 2024 according to 
<a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/6dfc19c3fdce4c9c8d5f1565c472b53f/2020-09-29-02-fr.pdf" target="_blank">IATA</a>. 
This option also takes into account the one-off change in the aircraft load factor in 2020, which has dropped to 
58.5% according to 
<a href="https://www.iata.org/contentassets/6dfc19c3fdce4c9c8d5f1565c472b53f/2020-09-29-02-fr.pdf" target="_blank">IATA</a>, 
against 82.4% in 2019. Thus, due to this deterioration in the aircraft load factor, a paradoxical situation is present 
on the tool. Indeed, the deterioration in the aircraft load factor, considered as a potential improvement in 
efficiency, leads here to an increase in emissions compared to those expected without modification of the 
efficiency levers of action. + E/ASK

LAST OPTION (TO BE DONE CORRECTED)

Lastly, a last option is provided for studying societal aspects on the distribution of flights. The results of this 
part are based on the work of S. GÃ¶ssling and A. Humpe in 2020 in 
<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378020307779" target="_blank">*The global scale, distribution and growth of aviation: Implications for climate change*</a>. 
The authors show that only 11% of the world's population flies, and only between 2 and 4% go abroad. Moreover, 
'frequent flyers', about 1% of the world's population who fly an average of 56,000 km per year (about 3 
long-range trips), are responsible for about 50% of aviation CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, taking into account their number of 
flights but also the more frequent use of upper classes. Therefore, if on average these 'frequent flyers' flew half 
as often, aviation emissions would be reduced by 25%.


#### Aircraft fleet and operations

The user can improve the aircraft fleet and operations. 

For that, a first slider allows introducing new aircraft into the fleet, which can be improved in terms of propulsion
(more efficient engines), aerodynamics, mass, systems or breakthrough architectures. Whereas basic options correspond to
constant efficiency at 2019 level or efficiency corresponding to fleet renewal with current more efficient aircraft 
(default option), others allow integrating future more efficient architecture. A trend option includes a deployment
similar to the previous one in terms of efficiency gains, Entry-Into-Service (EIS) year and fleet renewal rate, which 
corresponds to an annual efficiency gains of around 1%. A more optimistic solution considers the same assumptions with 
an accelerated fleet turnover. Finally, an ambitious option takes into account the introduction of very efficient 
aircraft.

Another slider represents the improvements in terms of operations through flight trajectories, air traffic management, 
formation flights or ground operations evolution. The user can choose efficiency gains more or less ambitious, from 0%
to 12% by 2050. For each option, the settings corresponding to the deployment of these solutions are similar, i.e. a 
duration of deployment of 20 years (for reaching 98% of the total gains) from 2025.

The user can also set the evolution of the mean aircraft load factor in 2050. The default setting corresponds to a 
trend estimation of 89% by 2050, but other settings are available: 82.4%, 85%, 92%, 95%. The more pessimistic option 
corresponds to 2019 value, whereas the more optimistic one is probably be hard to reach for all the fleet even if some
airlines have  already reached this value in 2019.

#### Aircraft energy

The user can define the energy that will be use by the future aircraft fleet. Here, only three main alternative fuels 
are considered as alternative energy carriers.

On the one hand, the user can define the future mix of drop-in fuels, i.e. fuels that can (almost) directly replace 
fossil kerosene such as biofuels and electrofuels. A default option corresponds to the exclusive use of fossil kerosene.
Then, a biofuel option represents the exclusive use of biofuels by 2050, with a progressive replacement of fossil
kerosene by biofuels from 2025. A similar one represents the exclusive use of electrofuels by 2050, with a progressive
replacement of fossil kerosene by electrofuels from 2030. Finally, the ReFuelEU option corresponds to the implementation
of the blending mandates at the european level, considering only drop-in fuels. This option considers the deployment of 
biofuels from 2025 and electrofuels from 2030, with a final mix in 2050 of 35% biofuels, 35% electrofuels and 30% fossil
kerosene.

On the other hand, the user can also introduce hydrogen aircraft into the fleet. This type of aircraft also requires 
dedicated architectures (unlike drop-in fuels) which will probably be limited to low ranges for structural reasons (low 
gravimetric index for hydrogen tanks). As a consequence, the settings used are based on the fleet renewal values.
The default option does not consider the use of hydrogen aircraft. A limited introduction considers a late EIS in 2040 
only for 50% of the short-range market, whereas a moderate one considers a forecast EIS in 2035 for the same market. 
Finally, an ambitious option includes the large deployment of hydrogen aircraft for all the short-range market from 
2035 and 50% of the medium-range market from 2040.

Concerning the production of these alternative fuels, the user can make assumptions on biofuel emission factors, 
hydrogen production pathways and electric mix. For biofuels, the default value corresponds to
the median value for HEFA pathway (20.7 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/MJ<sub>fuel</sub>), which is the most used pathway currently. 
A high-carbon value of 52.2 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/MJ<sub>fuel</sub> (corresponding to AtJ pathway) and a low-carbon value
of 7.7 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/MJ<sub>fuel</sub> (corresponding to FT pathway) can also be chosen. These values can be 
compared to the value of 88.7 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/MJ<sub>fuel</sub> for fossil kerosene (including production emissions).
Concerning hydrogen production, four options are proposed: a current one which is mainly a mix between steam reformation
of methane or the gasification of coal, two other ones based on steam reformation of methane only with or without carbon
capture and storage (CCS), a last one based on electrolysis whose emission factor depends on electricity mix. Finally, 
the electric mix can be assumed as more or less low-carbon, with a default option corresponding to the current world 
grid electric mix (429 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh). In addition to an illustrative option with high-carbon electricity
(1100 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh), two examples of grid electric mixes can be considered, assuming a transition for reaching 
medium- (240 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh) or low-carbon (70 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh) final mix by 2050. Moreover, a last 
option corresponds to dedicated electricity from renewable (20 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh) from today.


#### Climate & Energy

The

#### Allocations

Last, but not least, the user can assume allocation rules concerning the different environmental limits considered in
the model. It finally allows comparing absolute impacts of aviation with dedicated targets/limits for the sector.
The term allocation means here the result of complex mechanisms of negotiation, competition, arbitration and 
regulation for access to resources. Here, our issues, that are estimated using the climate and energy settings, are 
considered: the carbon budget, equivalent carbon budget (which corresponds roughly to temperature), biomass budget and 
electricity budget. Each time, several allocations are proposed. More specifically, grandfathering allocations can be 
assumed, which corresponds to the current impact of aviation on an environmental impact. For instance, aviation 
representing currently 2.6% of CO<sub>2</sub> emissions, the grandfathering allocation for carbon budget corresponds to 
2.6%. The justification of the default values are provided on the tooltips.

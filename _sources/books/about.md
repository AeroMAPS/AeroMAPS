# About AeroMAPS

AeroMAPS, formerly CAST, is an open-source framework developed in Python by ISAE-SUPAERO (Toulouse, France).
It is also fed by multiple multidisciplinary works from the Institute for Sustainable Aviation (ISA).
Providing a free framework that researchers, organizations, authorities and companies can interact with for
defining sustainable aviation prospective scenarios was the initial main motivation.

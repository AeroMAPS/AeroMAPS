### Energy resource sustainability

The assessment of energy sustainability is based on an approach similar to the one presented for climate issues. 
This time, rather than comparing cumulative emissions to carbon budgets, the energy consumption of a scenario is 
compared to available energy resource budgets. Only biomass and electricity energy resources are studied in this work. 
To simplify the comparisons, the availabilities are checked in 2050. A more comprehensive approach would be to check 
the availability of energy resources on an annual basis. 

In the same way as for carbon budgets, a (political) allocation of energy resources for aviation is assumed. The 
choice of a reference value can, for example, be based on the contribution of the sector to world energy or oil 
consumption (of the order of 2 to 3% or 7 to 8%). Thus, a scenario can be considered sustainable from an energy point 
of view if the consumption of energy resources in 2050 does not exceed the energy resource budget considered.

In the following, some examples of reasonable values are proposed.


#### Biomass availability

The estimation of the available biomass at the global level is complex and depends on several criteria. In this work, 
a statistical analysis of IRENA (International Renewable ENergy Agency) data is performed. The resource categories 
described for the biofuel pathways are used. The results are given in Tab.1. The lower and upper fences are determined 
to exclude extreme values (outliers).

| **Resource**           | **Lower fence** | **Q1** | **Median** | **Q3** | **Upper fence** |
|------------------------|-----------------|--------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Waste                  | 9               | 10     | 12         | 20     | 27              |
| Agricultural residues  | 10              | 30     | 57         | 103    | 204             |
| Forest residues        | 5               | 15     | 17         | 39     | 59              |
| Energy crops           | 8               | 37     | 63         | 109    | 217             |
| Algae                  | 5               | 8      | 15         | 31     | 50              |
| Total                  | 37              | 100    | 164        | 302    | 557             |

*Tab.1 Global biomass availability (in EJ) scenarios to 2050.*

The estimates in Tab.1 are refined using an analysis of the references {cite}`staples2017limits, staples2018aviation` 
to obtain detailed results for different resources. Concerning waste, used cooking oil represents a deposit of about 
1 EJ, the rest being household waste. Energy crops are divided into 63% lignocellulose, 9% vegetable oils and 28% sugar 
or starch-based materials.

The results obtained are consistent with {cite}`slade2014global` which concludes that likely estimates are less than 
300 EJ. Similarly, the results by resource type are of the same order of magnitude as those given in 
{cite}`o2021estimating`.


#### Electricity availability

Concerning electricity at the global level, the estimation is also complex due to technical, economic or political 
factors. Multiple availability scenarios are proposed by academic, industrial and institutional actors. Several 
scenarios are thus represented on Fig.1, with the estimation of the availability but also of the emission factor of 
the electricity mix. It is interesting to note the reference point in 2019 and the wide dispersion of the scenarios. 
On the other hand, all the scenarios forecast an increase in electricity production and a decrease in the emission 
factor. For comparison, the emission factors at the global level for low-carbon production means are lower than 
50 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh, with values of the order of 10 gCO<sub>2</sub>-eq/kWh for wind or nuclear power 
{cite}`IPCC-AR5`. In this work, the electricity energy resource budget is therefore based on these different estimates.
